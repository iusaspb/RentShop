= RentShop

This project is created to compare *JPA* vs *Reactive*  to
work with a relational database (*PostgreSQL*) on a standard task of
managing a cart with products for renting.

Let's describe the main entities of the model.

*Product* is what is rented.

*Item* is an product instance that can be rented.

*Contractor* is the one who rents the product.
Contractor creates an order (a cart) to which products are added for a certain rental period at the current price.
Each product may have its own rental period.
While the order is not completed where you can add or remove products.
As soon as the order is completed, the contractor starts using these product.
Once all items have been returned, the order will be closed.

Below is a diagram of the main entities.
